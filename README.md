# WinGameAlpha

# Importing Textures
To start the game, a `textures` folder must be stored in the same directory as the game. The latest default textures should be included with the binary in the release however you may replace these textures as specified in the [WinGameAlpha Texture Editor](https://github.com/WizziBot/WGA_Texture_Editor).
# How to play

## Controls
* `W` + `S` Controls the up and down movement of the player on the left.
* `Up` + `Down` (arrowkeys) control the up and down movement of the player on the right.
* `Esc` used to play and pause the game, the game will start up in the paused state, hence press Esc to play.
* `R` used to reset the position of the ball to the centre of the arena.
* `Ctrl+R` same thing as `R` but also resets the scores.

## Objective
There is no end of the game or highscore, the objective is to beat your opponent by 'scoring' as many points as possible until an agreed upon winning score or highest of however many within an agreed upon time period.
